## ML Model Deployment on AWS for Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

## Churn rate, also known as turnover or customer churn, is the rate at which a customer suspends a transaction with a company. Most commonly, it is expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who canceled their subscription within a certain time period. In this project, We aim to deploy a model which predicts whether the customer is going to churn in the near future or not. Amazon Web Services(AWS) is used as a cloud provider.
